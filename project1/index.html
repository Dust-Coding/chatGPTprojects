            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Dustin Galichia, I'm 27 and am currently working as a Driver Manager at Butler Transport in Kansas City.
                The year is 2023 and for my New Year resolution, I decided that I would finally take my girlfriends advice and start 
                to pursue learning to code so I can hopefully get a job in the technology sector.
            </p>
            <p>I have previously, in late 2022, started learning the coding language Python and even enrolled in college shortly after starting.
                That was a mistake, I tried to jump into the deep end and ultimatly ended up discouraged. After stepping away for few months, I 
                decided to give it another go, but this time start with the foundations (HTML5, CSS and JavaScript). I still have a long long way 
                to go but as of January 31<super>st</super>, I can confidently say that I feel I have HTML5 down (for the most part) and a decent bit
                of CSS down (still working on understanding the box model). By the end of Febuary, I want to have HTML5, CSS and JavaScript fully down that way 
                I can start learning the back-end development. Ultimatly my goal is to be able to develop applications and also develop a complex AI system that can 
                run anything.
